<h1>Welcome to the SimGrid Eclipse Plug-in Project!</h1>
<p>The SimGrid Eclipse Plug-in helps new users to get a first step in SimGrid simulation by automatically generating files needed in order to run a simulation using SimGrid. 
</p>
<p>
One of its main strength is the platform editor that allows easy visualization and editing of platform description files, that can also be appreciated by advanced users.
</p>
 
<h2>Main Features</h2>
<p>

<h2>SimGrid?</h2>
<p>SimGrid is a toolkit that provides core functionalities for the simulation of distributed applications in heterogeneous distributed environments. The specific goal of the project is to facilitate research in the area of parallel and distributed large scale systems, such as Grids, P2P systems and clouds. Its use cases encompass heuristic evaluation, application prototyping or even real application development and tuning.
