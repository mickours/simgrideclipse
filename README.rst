SimGrid Eclipse Plug-in
=======================

The SimGrid Eclipse Plug-in helps new users to get a first step in SimGrid
simulation by automatically generating files needed in order to run a
simulation using SimGrid.

One of its main strength is the platform editor that allows easy visualization
and editing of platform description files, that can also be appreciated by
advanced users.
